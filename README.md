Visit the [My Aquarium](https://jiji-thecat.github.io/my-aquarium/) website to create your own aquarium. You can adjust the volume of fish as much as you like, from 0 to 500.

For this app, I utilized the following technologies for learning purposes:

1. JavaScript animation
2. TypeScript
3. Webpack

One of the technical challenges I encountered was with the animation logic. I got stuck on a simple mistake or typo, which led to wasted time trying to figure out why the logic wasn't working. I need to sharpen my ability to identify these errors. Additionally, creating `webpack.config.ts` wasn't easy due to the extensive configuration requirements, necessitating time for searching and reading the documentation.

## How to Install and Run

Follow these steps:

1. Run `yarn` and install the dependencies.
2. Execute `yarn run build` and create bundle file.
3. Load `dist/index.html` in your browser.

## How to Use This App

You can adjust the volume of fish by clicking and controlling the slider knob, ranging from 0 to 500. Additionally, on the right side, you can view the types and quantities of fish currently in your tank.
